.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-node\fR \- View and manage node definitions\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet node \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus TERMINUS]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This subcommand interacts with node objects, which are used by Puppet to build a catalog\. A node object consists of the node\'s facts, environment, node parameters (exposed in the parser as top\-scope variables), and classes\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR is a valid configuration parameter, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttp://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-mode MODE
The run mode to use for the current action\. Valid modes are \fBuser\fR, \fBagent\fR, and \fBmaster\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.

\fBfind\fR
.
.P
Retrieve an "empty" (no classes, no ENC\-imposed parameters, and an environment of "production") node:
.
.P
$ puppet node find somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan \-\-terminus plain \-\-render\-as yaml
.
.P
Retrieve a node using the puppet master\'s configured ENC:
.
.P
$ puppet node find somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan \-\-terminus exec \-\-mode master \-\-render\-as yaml
.
.P
Retrieve the same node from the puppet master:
.
.P
