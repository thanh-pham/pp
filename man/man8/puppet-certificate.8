.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-certificate\fR \- Provide access to the CA for certificate management\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet certificate \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-ca\-location LOCATION]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This subcommand interacts with a local or remote Puppet certificate authority\. Currently, its behavior is not a full superset of \fBpuppet cert\fR; specifically, it is unable to mimic puppet cert\'s "clean" option, and its "generate" action submits a CSR rather than creating a signed certificate\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR is a valid configuration parameter, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttp://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-mode MODE
The run mode to use for the current action\. Valid modes are \fBuser\fR, \fBagent\fR, and \fBmaster\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-ca\-location LOCATION
Whether to act on the local certificate authority or one provided by a remote puppet master\. Allowed values are \'local\' and \'remote\.\'
.
.IP
This option is required\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.
.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.
.TP
\fBdestroy\fR \- Delete a certificate\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate destroy [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-ca\-location LOCATION] \fIhost\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Deletes a certificate\. This action currently only works on the local CA\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
Nothing\.
.
.TP
\fBfind\fR \- Retrieve a certificate\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate find [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-ca\-location LOCATION] \fIhost\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieve a certificate\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
An x509 SSL certificate\. You will usually want to render this as a string (\-\-render\-as s)\.
.
.IP
Note that this action has a side effect of caching a copy of the certificate in Puppet\'s \fBssldir\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBgenerate\fR \- Generate a new certificate signing request\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate generate [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-ca\-location LOCATION] \fIhost\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Generates and submits a certificate signing request (CSR) for the specified host\. This CSR will then have to be signed by a user with the proper authorization on the certificate authority\.
.
.IP
Puppet agent usually handles CSR submission automatically\. This action is primarily useful for requesting certificates for individual users and external applications\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
Nothing\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \- Print the default terminus class for this face\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate info [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-ca\-location LOCATION]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand\. Note that different run modes may have different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the \'\-\-mode\' option\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR \- List all certificate signing requests\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate list [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-ca\-location LOCATION]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
List all certificate signing requests\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
An array of #inspect output from CSR objects\. This output is currently messy, but does contain the names of nodes requesting certificates\. This action returns #inspect strings even when used from the Ruby API\.
.
.TP
\fBsave\fR \- Invalid for this subcommand\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate save [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-ca\-location LOCATION]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Invalid for this subcommand\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR \- Invalid for this subcommand\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate search [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-ca\-location LOCATION] \fIquery\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Invalid for this subcommand\.
.
.TP
\fBsign\fR \- Sign a certificate signing request for HOST\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate sign [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-ca\-location LOCATION] \fIhost\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Sign a certificate signing request for HOST\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
A string that appears to be (but isn\'t) an x509 certificate\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBgenerate\fR
.
.P
Request a certificate for "somenode" from the site\'s CA:
.
.P
$ puppet certificate generate somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan \-\-ca\-location remote
.
.P
\fBsign\fR
.
.P
Sign somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan\'s certificate:
.
.P
$ puppet certificate sign somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan \-\-ca\-location remote
.
