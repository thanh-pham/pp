.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-certificate_request\fR \- Manage certificate requests\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet certificate_request \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus TERMINUS]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This subcommand retrieves and submits certificate signing requests (CSRs)\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR is a valid configuration parameter, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttp://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-mode MODE
The run mode to use for the current action\. Valid modes are \fBuser\fR, \fBagent\fR, and \fBmaster\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.
.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.
.TP
\fBdestroy\fR \- Invalid for this subcommand\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_request destroy [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] \fIkey\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Invalid for this subcommand\.
.
.TP
\fBfind\fR \- Retrieve a single CSR\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_request find [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] \fIhost\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieve a single CSR\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
A single certificate request\. When used from the Ruby API, returns a Puppet::SSL::CertificateRequest object\.
.
.IP
RENDERING ISSUES: In most cases, you will want to render this as a string (\'\-\-render\-as s\')\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \- Print the default terminus class for this face\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_request info [\-\-terminus TERMINUS]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand\. Note that different run modes may have different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the \'\-\-mode\' option\.
.
.TP
\fBsave\fR \- API only: submit a certificate signing request\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_request save [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] \fIx509_CSR\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
API only: create or overwrite an object\. As the Faces framework does not currently accept data from STDIN, save actions cannot currently be invoked from the command line\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR \- Retrieve all outstanding CSRs\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_request search [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] \fIdummy_text\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieve all outstanding CSRs\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
A list of certificate requests; be sure to to render this as a string (\'\-\-render\-as s\')\. When used from the Ruby API, returns an array of Puppet::SSL::CertificateRequest objects\.
.
.IP
\fBNOTES\fR
.
.IP
Although this action always returns all CSRs, it requires a dummy search key; this is a known bug\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBfind\fR
.
.P
Retrieve a single CSR from the puppet master\'s CA:
.
.P
$ puppet certificate_request find somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan \-\-terminus rest
.
.P
\fBsearch\fR
.
.P
Retrieve all CSRs from the local CA (similar to \'puppet cert list\'):
.
.P
$ puppet certificate_request search x \-\-terminus ca
.
.SH "NOTES"
