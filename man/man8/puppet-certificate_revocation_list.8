.TH "PUPPET\-CERTIFICATE_REVOCATION_LIST" "8" "June 2011" "Puppet Labs, LLC" "Puppet manual"
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-certificate_revocation_list\fR \- Manage the list of revoked certificates\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet certificate_revocation_list \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus TERMINUS]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This subcommand is primarily for retrieving the certificate revocation list from the CA\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR is a valid configuration parameter, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttp://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-mode MODE
The run mode to use for the current action\. Valid modes are \fBuser\fR, \fBagent\fR, and \fBmaster\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.
.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.
.TP
\fBdestroy\fR \- Delete the certificate revocation list\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_revocation_list destroy [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] \fIdummy_text\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Deletes the certificate revocation list\. This cannot be done over REST, but it is possible to delete the locally cached copy or the local CA\'s copy of the CRL\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
Nothing\.
.
.IP
\fBNOTES\fR
.
.IP
Although this action always deletes the CRL from the specified terminus, it requires a dummy argument; this is a known bug\.
.
.TP
\fBfind\fR \- Retrieve the certificate revocation list\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_revocation_list find [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] \fIdummy_text\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieve the certificate revocation list\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
The certificate revocation list\. When used from the Ruby API: returns an OpenSSL::X509::CRL object\.
.
.IP
RENDERING ISSUES: this should usually be rendered as a string (\'\-\-render\-as s\')\.
.
.IP
\fBNOTES\fR
.
.IP
Although this action always returns the CRL from the specified terminus, it requires a dummy argument; this is a known bug\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \- Print the default terminus class for this face\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_revocation_list info [\-\-terminus TERMINUS]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand\. Note that different run modes may have different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the \'\-\-mode\' option\.
.
.TP
\fBsave\fR \- Invalid for this subcommand\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_revocation_list save [\-\-terminus TERMINUS]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Invalid for this subcommand\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR \- Invalid for this subcommand\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP

.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Invalid for this subcommand\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBfind\fR
.
.P
Retrieve a copy of the puppet master\'s CRL:
.
.P
$ puppet certificate_revocation_list find crl \-\-terminus rest
